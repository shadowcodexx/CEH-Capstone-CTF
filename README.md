# CEH-Capstone-CTF
This repository contains my work on the Capture the Flag (CTF) activity from the Cisco Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) course. It documents the process of conducting a penetration test, including SQL injection, exploiting web server vulnerabilities, accessing open Samba shares, and analyzing Wireshark capture files to find flags.
